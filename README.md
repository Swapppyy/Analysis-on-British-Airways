## Analysis on British Airways (Tableau)

### Introduction:

In this project, I conducted comprehensive data analysis on the datasets of Adventures Work, a bike selling company, spanning from 2020 to 2023. The datasets comprised various categories and sub-categories of products, sales figures, returns, demographics, and customer information. Using Power BI, I meticulously cleaned and transformed the data, establishing relationships between different data elements through data modeling. 

I visualized the insights obtained from the analysis using a variety of tools such as cards, line charts, bar graphs, and slicers to gain a deeper understanding of the data. The analysis culminated in the creation of four distinct reports: the Executive Dashboard, Map Dashboard, Product Detail Dashboard, and Customer Detail Dashboard. 

These dashboards serve as a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to gain insights into different aspects of Adventures Work's operations, including sales performance, geographic distribution, product details, and customer demographics. Through this project, valuable insights were derived to inform decision-making and strategic planning within the company.
